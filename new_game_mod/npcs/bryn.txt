him=Back foul beast!
you=Take it easy feller
him=Wait? Your of this world?
you=Last time I checked. Whats going on here?
him=Its not good. Spirits started appearing 3 days back.
him=It all started when Tarlek left the asylum. He was taken away by a group of the Sarlinian.
him=After a while, the governor started acting strange and talking to himself. Then the spirits started to appear.
him=Before long, the whole place was overrun by undead.
you=You seem to be unharmed. How did you survive?
him=The wardens started getting edgy when the spirits appeared. They started losing their minds after a while and I havent seen them now for a couple of days.
him=Somehow the asylum residents didnt seem to be affected by the dark presence.
him=Either that or their minds were too far gone to begin with.
you=Your mind seems to be intact. What are you here for?
him=At the moment im fine. Not all days are so good.
him=If your planning to investigate the goings on, you should head towards the governors office at the end of the asylum.
you=What about you? Will you be okay?
him=Ill be fine. Ill make my way out as soon as... well never mind that now. Go on ahead.
you=Okay. Ill be back.

him=Hello again.
you=Hey you made it out of the asylum. What on earth are you doing here.
him=After I left the asylum, I needed to find a safe place to hide out.
you=You had better be careful. There was a wild bear on the loose around here.
him=Dont worry about that.
you=You have taken care of one?
him=Not exactly. Theres nothing in here except for me.
him=That bear you saw. That would be me. That was quite a performance last time.
him=I go through a physical transformation, causing me to take the form of a bear. I was inflicted with this many years ago when I was attacked by such a creature.
you=So does that mean that im going to be affected.
him=Its possibly yes.
you=So im going to get hairy and grow big teeth?
him=With training, some can control the beast, but it requires great physical strength.
him=Come and see me if you run into trouble. I may be able to offer some assistance, but for now, I need to get back on my feet.
you=Okay. Stay out of trouble.

him=Well met brother.
you=Good to see you again. Thanks for joining us.
him=Its my pleasure. Allow me to offer my serices as a crafter.
him=Back before I lived in solitude, I used to spend my time creating magical artifacts.
him=Its been some time since I created anything but I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
him=I remember a formula for a magic ring. I dont know how useful it will be but I need a bit of practice again before I will be able to perform the most powerful craftings.
him=To create the ring, I will need a spider leg, a yellow rose and a vial of dew.
him=Bring these to me, and I will craft the ring.
