you=Good day.
him=Oh a visitor. I dont get many around here. Now where did you come from?
you=I have travelled from x in the south.
him=Impressive. You must have come through the Wyvern cave. Not many can make it through. Now what brings you up here?
you=Battle preparations. x was attacked by the y some time ago and we are expecting a larger attack soon.
him=Now that wont do at all. I'll have none of that fighting nonsense here.
you=Indeed...
him=If they think they can throw their weight around here, theyll find a jolly good talking to waiting for them.
you=Thats one approach.
him=So what are you doing about it?
you=Im looking for allies to help tip the balance
him=I might be able to help with that. Let me consult my spell book now...
him=Yes here it is. The wyverns power can be harnessed. All I need is a wyvern tail from each of the elemental wyverns. If you didnt get those, you had better go back to the Wyvern cave.
him=I will also need a catalyst of some kind. Hmm yes that should work.
him=Head into the woods east of here and collect a Fire Antlion heart.
you=Collect one? You mean take one from a Fire Antlion?
him=Well of course the Fire Antlions might not hand it to you willingly. Dont be so squeamish.
you=Okay im going.

him=Put this here... Rub this... turn this... Whats this part?...
him=Hey presto.
you=Whats that?
him=You need to drink this. Here. Make sure it all goes down.
you=Bleaugh. That tastes foul.
him=Dont be such a baby. Its done.
him=You might need to invest a little training in it before you can get the full benefit.
him=Now time for payment.
you=I dont remember anything about payment.
him=you dont expect something for nothing. Dont worry I just need a small errand taken care of.
you=What errand?
him=In the woods I have recently seen a large beast roaming around. I dont know what it is but I think its coming from a cave in the southeast part of the wood.
him=Go and check it out for me.

him=Strange. We dont usually get bears in these woods.
you=It seemed a little strange. Its eyes seemed almost human. I feel a bit funny after fighting it.
him=Could it be...
you=What is it?
him=Im not certain but I think you should go back and check on it again.

you=Good to see you too.
him=Dont get all sentamental now. Time to focus.

him=This will be your biggest challenge yet. Good luck.
