him=Thank heavens your safe! That was a close call back there. Are you hurt?
you=A few bruises maybe. I can handle myself.
him=Hah! I dont doubt it my friend. But dont get careless. We arent safe yet.
you=What are we facing?
him=A few of the Sarlinian got through ahead of us. No doubt we can expect a few of their undead minions.
you=Could be tricky.
him=There will still be a few of the Sarlinian behind us. Ill guard the rear and make sure none make it through.
him=Up ahead is a small settlement. We should be safe there for the moment.
you=I'll go on ahead and clear a path. Meet me at the settlement when your ready.
him=Understood.

him=What took you so long? Had a little trouble?
you=What the...
him=Never mind that now. What are we going to do about the x scum.
you=Keep your head Ieuan.
him=I know, i know.
you=Its unusual to see them this far south. What are they up to?
him=Before we left Cambria, I spoke to Kai. He thinks that this was just a scout party and that the Sarlinian will be back with a greater force.
you=Just a scout party? If thats true then we're in trouble. Theres no way we could withstand a larger force.
him=Our best chance is to increase our own numbers. It could be difficult since theres not much civilisation around these parts.
you=I'll talk to the folk around here and see what we can find out about the area.
him=The Woodsman at the north of town is handy with a bow. It might be worth talking to him.
you=Ok thanks for the tip. We will have a small army before you know it.
him=I wouldn't count on it. But in the mean time, I suggest you get more familiar with your weapon. If we are going to face the Sarlinian again, we will need to be much better prepared.
him=Kai sees a lot of potential in you but your still lacking in combat experience.

him=Yes I fear you are right. Theres no telling when the Sarlinian might be on us again.
him=Alas I'll be staying here a while longer. I want to get a message back to Kai before I leave here.
him=Evan tells me of an asylum built in a desert to the north. A couple of the Sarlinian generals were supposedly previous residents of the asylum. I bet we would find out more information from there.
you=Okay I'll head north from here.
him=I dont know how long I will stay here but I'll catch up to you on the road.
you=Got it.

him=Hey! I havent been sitting on my laurels.
him=It looks like you have been busy too. How are battle preparations?
you=I have learned a thing or two on my travels.
him=You seem much stronger than the last time I saw you. How fares the search for allies?
you=I met a few friends on my journey and have a few troops to fight with me.
him=Thats good news. I hope it will be enough. I come with news of the Sarlinian.
him=They are advancing already. We need to make our final battle preperations soon.
you=We knew this day would come. This is the time to show our worth. Is there anything else we can do?
him=Lets see what you've got here...
him=Hmm. I'm sure theres some better equipment for you to get hold of yet.
him=But first, theres a dungeon not too far from here. I found an old tome back in the town.
him=It tells of an ancient guardian locked away at the bottom of the dungeon.
him=If we had such an ancient power fighting with us, I'm sure it would give us an advantage.
you=So its a friendly guardian? I just toddle down the dungeon and ask it if it wants to join us?
him=Okay I admit, the text was not too clear on all the details. You could have a fight on your hands.
you=Well it'll be some sword practice in any case.
him=The dungeon is to the west of here, beyond the marshlands.
you=I'll head there now.
him=Next time we meet, we will be heading into battle.

you=No pressure then.
